============


Stable release
--------------
For a conda environment with necessary packages:
.. code-block:: console

    $ conda env create -f environment.yml

..
    To install syncell, run this command in your terminal:
    
    .. code-block:: console
    
        $ pip install syncell
    
    This is the preferred method to install syncell, as it will always install the most recent stable release.
    
    If you don't have `pip`_ installed, this `Python installation guide`_ can guide
    you through the process.
